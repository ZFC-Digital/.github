# ZFC Digital

This organization was created to contribute to the open source community. It offers open source projects that are updated at no cost or obligation.
However, it accepts sponsorships to keep these open source projects going. 

All projects in this organization are open source and free. For this reason, you should be respectful and refrain from being pushy and sarcastic. If you like open source and want to contribute, you can send a pull request to the repositories. Thank you.
